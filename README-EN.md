</details>

## Installation
Method 1
1. Copy the files to ComfyUI's custom_nodes directory
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Restart ComfyUI

Method 2 (Recommended)
Use Manager or launcher for installation

## Language Switching

This extension now supports ComfyUI's native internationalization (i18n) system, allowing switching between Chinese and English interfaces:

1. Switch languages: Select language options in the settings menu in the upper right corner of the ComfyUI interface
2. Choose Chinese (zh) or English (en)
3. Currently only supports node translation, frontend functionality translation is not yet supported

## Version History
- v2.3.0 (2025-05-14)
  - Interface Layout Alpha 2.0 version released, with improved interface and basic tools
  - Now you can synchronize the width, height, and size of selected nodes, and align all selected nodes
  - Still a test version, please report bugs if you find any

- v2.2.0 (2025-05-13)
  - Added support for ComfyUI's native internationalization (i18n) system
  - Now can seamlessly switch between Chinese and English interfaces
  - All node names, descriptions, parameters, and outputs support bilingual display
  - Removed modular functionality from the smart layout (may be replaced with custom templates in the future)

- v2.1.2 (2025-05-12)
  - Further improved animation performance and effects, fixed some path bugs in animations

- v2.1.1 (2025-05-08)
  - Fixed compatibility issues between connection animation and the cg-use-everywhere plugin
  - When animation is disabled, it will use cg-use-everywhere's animation implementation (refresh browser if not working)
  - Fixed a serious bug in the smart layout functionality

- v2.1.0 (2025-05-08)
  - Modularized connection animation effects for easier maintenance and future additions
  - Optimized animation performance and algorithms, added animation sampling strength options
